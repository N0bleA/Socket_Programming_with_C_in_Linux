In this assignment, i have gained experience in Cyclic redundancy check (CRC) computation
in order to provide network packet integrity check. I implemented an error detection code, CRC-32, to protect the message integrity of the com-
munication between a client and server. I implemented a UDP client-server model,
compute the redundancy in terms of CRC at the sender side and check the redundancy at
the receiver side. In this assignment, I implemented a UDP ECHO servers that
always sends back whatever data they received. A CRC should always be computed for the
data that is sending and receiving in order to provide data integrity.
